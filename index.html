    <p>Coming to America</p>
    <p>
      Coming to America follows Prince Akeem Joffer of Zamunda, who travels to
      America with his loyal friend Semmi to find a wife who will love him for
      who he is, not his royal status. Disguised as a poor man, Akeem lands in
      Queens, New York, and takes a job at a fast food restaurant owned by Lisa
      McDowell. As he falls in love with Lisa, he struggles to maintain his
      secret while dealing with his overbearing father, King Jaffe, who insists
      Akeem return home and fulfill his royal duties. Akeem and Semmi navigate a
      series of comedic situations, including misunderstandings and cultural
      clashes. Ultimately, Akeem proves that love, not wealth, is the key to
      happiness, leading to a joyful conclusion with Lisa.
